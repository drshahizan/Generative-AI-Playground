# ChatGPT Expert Prompts

"**ChatGPT Expert Prompts**" is a feature provided by **OpenAI** that allows users to input a **system message** or **prompt** at the beginning of a conversation with the **ChatGPT** language model. The purpose of this feature is to guide the AI's responses and behavior throughout the conversation. By providing **context**, **instructions**, or specific **cues** in the system message, users can influence the direction of the conversation and obtain more relevant and accurate responses from the AI.

For instance, in a dialogue scenario, you can start the conversation with a system message like "**You are a medical assistant**. Provide information about **common cold symptoms and prevention**." This would set the tone for the conversation and instruct the AI to generate responses in line with the role of a medical assistant providing information about cold symptoms and prevention.

Overall, **ChatGPT Expert Prompts** help users have more controlled and productive interactions with the AI by steering the conversation according to their needs and preferences.

# Tips to create powerful prompts

## 1. Be Precise and Specific
   - Clearly state your desired outcome with specific keywords or phrases.
   - Instead of vague instructions, provide detailed context. For example, "Generate a detailed overview of Malaysia's tourism industry, including popular destinations, tourist demographics, and recent trends." is more effective than "Overview of Malaysia's tourism industry"

## 2. Use Positive Instructions
   - Frame your prompt in a positive manner. Tell Copilot what you want it to do, rather than what you don’t want.
For instance, use “Create a summary of this article” instead of “Don’t generate a lengthy response.”

## 3. Provide Examples and Inputs/Outputs
   - Include examples of inputs and expected outputs. This helps Copilot understand your intent.
   - If you're asking Copilot to write code, provide sample input/output pairs or describe edge cases.
   - Example: "Generate a comparative analysis of Malaysia's education system and its impact on economic development, using examples from other countries for reference".

## 4. Use Natural Language
   - Write prompts as if you're conversing with a helpful coworker. Be clear and concise.
   - Imagine explaining the task to someone who doesn't know the specifics.
   - Example: "Provide an overview of Malaysia's political history, including key events, influential leaders, and the country's democratic framework."


## 5. Iterate and Refine
   - If the initial result isn't what you wanted, iterate. Adjust your prompt to avoid mistakes.
   - Regenerate responses until you get the desired output.
   - Example:  "Generate a report on Malaysia's efforts to promote sustainable development, focusing on initiatives, challenges, and future goals."
