# Chat with Copilot regarding the PDF file
**Microsoft Copilot** can assist with PDF files, even though it doesn't have a dedicated feature for parsing and analyzing them. Here's how you can use Copilot with PDFs:

1. **Summarizing PDFs**:
   - Open the PDF file in the **Microsoft Edge browser**.
   - In the **Dev tools section**, click the **Microsoft Copilot button** located at the top right corner.
   - Select the **Chat option**.
   - In the text field, enter a prompt telling Copilot to **summarize the PDF**.

2. **Manual Interaction**:
   - You can also **drag and drop** the PDF file into the Copilot chat box (or select the **'Add a file'** option).
   - Once the file is in place, proceed to make a request to Copilot. For example, you can simply ask it to **summarize** the content, and Copilot will provide a summary¬≤.

Copilot's ability to extract information from PDFs relies on its advanced natural language processing capabilities. Feel free to explore and interact with Copilot to enhance your productivity! üöÄüìÑ
