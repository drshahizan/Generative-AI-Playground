#### Step 2: Capturing Your Ideas ✍️

1. **Add a New Note** 
   - Click the **“+”** button to create a new note. Each note appears as a card on your canvas. You can type out a thought, idea, or inspiration — no matter how small or big. Keep the notes short and simple to make connecting them easier later.

2. **Use Voice or Text Capture** 
   - Napkin.ai allows you to input notes via typing or using a voice input feature. This makes it ideal for capturing thoughts even when you’re on the go.

#### Step 3: Organizing Your Ideas 📂

1. **Automatic Organization** 
   - Napkin.ai will automatically organize your notes. There's no need to create folders or tags — the AI works behind the scenes to link related ideas based on their content. This feature allows you to focus on brainstorming and creativity without getting bogged down by organization.

2. **View the Digital Canvas** 
   - Your notes will be presented on a digital canvas in card form. This visual approach helps you see all your ideas at once, allowing you to spot trends and build a broader understanding of your concepts.

#### Step 4: Connecting Your Thoughts 🤖🔗

2. **Explore Connections** 
   - Click on a note to view other related notes suggested by the AI. This helps you explore different angles and build on the connections between thoughts.

#### Step 5: Revisiting Past Notes 🔄💡

1. **Memory Triggering** 
   - The AI occasionally surfaces older notes that might be relevant to your current focus. This feature is designed to help you rediscover ideas you may have forgotten and add depth to new projects.

2. **Review and Expand Ideas** 
   - As older notes are surfaced, you can expand them with additional details or link them to newer ideas. This keeps the creative process dynamic and your workspace evolving.

#### Step 6: Using Tags and Filtering Notes 🔍

1. **Manual Tags** 
   - While Napkin.ai largely automates organization, you can still add manual tags to notes for additional categorization if needed. Tags help when searching for specific notes or organizing large projects.

2. **Filter and Search** 
   - Use the **search** bar to quickly locate notes. You can also apply filters based on tags or content to focus on specific ideas.

#### Step 7: Collaborating with Others 🤝

1. **Invite Team Members** 
   - Napkin.ai supports collaboration. You can invite teammates or colleagues to contribute to your workspace. Shared workspaces are great for brainstorming sessions and collaborative idea development.

2. **Share Notes** 
   - Individual notes or collections can be shared via links, allowing you to easily get feedback or share ideas with others.

#### Step 8: Exporting Your Ideas 📤

1. **Export Notes** 
   - When you’re ready to share your ideas outside of Napkin.ai, you can export your notes in various formats, such as PDF or text. This feature makes it simple to integrate your brainstorming into presentations or reports.
